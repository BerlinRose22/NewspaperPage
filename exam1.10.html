		The Congress said “that no matter what happens, Prime Minister Narendra Modi cannot postpone receiving accolades”. The party also quoted incidents in Poonch, Rajouri, Ladakh and Kargil where the PM allegedly did not take “cognizance” of terror attacks.In another video, it said that “when the screams of the families of the martyrs are tearing everyone’s heart, the insensitive PM was busy campaigning in Madhya Pradesh and asking for votes.”
